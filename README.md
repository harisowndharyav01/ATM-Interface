## Introduction

This project consists of two main classes: `BankAccount` and `ATM`. The `BankAccount` class represents a bank account, encapsulating its balance and providing methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking balance. The `ATM` class interacts with the user, presenting a menu of options and facilitating operations on the bank account.

## Features

- Deposit: Users can deposit funds into their bank account.
- Withdrawal: Users can withdraw funds from their bank account, subject to availability.
- Balance Inquiry: Users can check the current balance of their bank account.
- User-Friendly Interface: The ATM provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java source files using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac`).
3. Run the `Main` class to start the ATM interface.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform desired operations on your bank account.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-account-atm.git
cd bank-account-atm
javac Main.java
java Main
```
## How it Works
The BankAccount class represents a bank account, providing methods to deposit, withdraw, and check balance. The ATM class interacts with the user, presenting options to perform operations on the bank account. Users can select options such as deposit, withdrawal, check balance, or exit.
